## Motivation
E-commerce has transformed shopping by eliminating geographical and temporal boundaries, enabling consumers to shop anytime and anywhere. My motivation for this project stems from a deep interest in understanding the operational dynamics of e-commerce platforms, their impact on consumer behavior, and how data analytics can reveal key business insights. By working on this project, I aim to uncover patterns, track sales performance, and understand customer preferences, contributing to better business strategies in the e-commerce industry.
